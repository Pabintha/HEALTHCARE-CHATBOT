# HEALTHCARE-CHATBOT

# Healthcare Chatbot

This healthcare chatbot is designed to assist in the diagnosis of diseases based on input symptoms. 
It utilizes machine learning algorithms, including Decision Tree Classifier and Support Vector Machine, to predict the possible disease based on the symptoms provided by the user.


To use this chatbot, ensure you have Python 3.x installed.

## Usage

To use the chatbot, run the script 'healthcare_chatbot.py'. 
The script will interact with the user, asking for symptoms, and provide a possible diagnosis along with relevant information such as descriptions and precautions.

## Data Files

The chatbot relies on the following data files in CSV format:
- Training.csv: Contains the training data for the machine learning models.
- Testing.csv: Contains the testing data for the evaluation of the trained models.
- symptom_Description.csv: Provides descriptions of various symptoms.
- Symptom_severity.csv: Contains the severity of different symptoms.
- symptom_precaution.csv: Provides precautions for different diseases.

Ensure that the CSV files are properly formatted and contain the necessary information for the chatbot to function correctly.

## Acknowledgements

- The project is built using Python and various libraries, including pandas, scikit-learn, and pyttsx3.
- The decision tree model and SVM are adapted from scikit-learn's machine learning library.
